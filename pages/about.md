With a career in IT spanning nearly three decades, I’ve been privileged to work at the forefront of technology and innovation since 1996. Over the years, I’ve contributed to the success of iconic brands such as BlackBerry, Jimmy Choo, and Hugo Boss, gaining diverse experience across the tech and fashion industries. In 2012, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey and founded The Milk Men, a Managed Services Provider (MSP) that has grown into a trusted partner for businesses seeking expert IT support, strategic guidance, and cutting-edge solutions.

Building on over a decade of success with [The Milk Men](https://themilkmen.com), I recently launched [MILK Mobile](https://milkmobile.com), a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) and travel SIM provider designed to deliver seamless connectivity to global travelers. Combining my deep understanding of IT with a passion for problem-solving, I strive to create services that are intuitive, reliable, and tailored to modern needs.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I’m an avid enthusiast of whiskey, coffee, and all things LEGO. I enjoy upcycling old tech, breathing new life into devices that might otherwise be discarded, and cycling for both recreation and inspiration. A dedicated Star Trek fan, I often find parallels between the optimism of the series and the boundless potential of technology to drive positive change.
